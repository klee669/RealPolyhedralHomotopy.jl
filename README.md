# RealPolyhedralHomotopy.jl

`RealPolyhedralHomotopy.jl` is a package for finding real roots of systems of polynomial equations using polyhedral homotopy.
The package implements the algorithm for the real polyhedral homotopy establised in [A Polyhedral Homotopy Algorithm For Real Zeros](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01957). The idea for the real polyhedral homotopy motivated from the celebrated article [A Polyhedral Method for Solving Sparse Polynomial Systems](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2153370?seq=1) to apply the polyhedral homotopy method for real roots finding.
